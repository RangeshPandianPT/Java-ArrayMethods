📦 Java Array Methods: A Practical Guide

This guide covers common array-related methods and utilities in Java, helping you manipulate and process arrays efficiently. While arrays in Java don’t have built-in methods like in some languages, the java.util.Arrays class provides powerful static methods for working with them.

📌 Description: Java Array Methods

1. In Java, arrays are fundamental data structures used to store multiple values of the same type. While arrays themselves have limited functionality, the java.util.Arrays class provides a powerful set of static utility methods to manipulate and work with arrays more effectively.

2. These methods include operations such as sorting, searching, copying, filling, comparing, and converting arrays to strings. Mastering these built-in tools allows developers to handle arrays more efficiently and write cleaner, more maintainable code.

3. This project demonstrates the most commonly used array methods in Java, providing practical examples to help you understand their syntax and usage.

🔑 Key Features of Array Methods 

✅ Provided by java.util.Arrays class – Java arrays don’t have built-in methods, but the Arrays class offers static utility methods to work with them.

🔁 Sorting – Arrays.sort() sorts arrays in ascending order.

🔍 Searching – Arrays.binarySearch() finds the index of an element in a sorted array.

🧪 Comparison – Arrays.equals() checks if two arrays have the same elements in the same order.

🧬 Copying – Arrays.copyOf() and Arrays.copyOfRange() create new arrays from existing ones.

🧱 Filling – Arrays.fill() sets all or part of an array to a specific value.

📝 Conversion – Arrays.toString() converts an array to a string for easy printing.
